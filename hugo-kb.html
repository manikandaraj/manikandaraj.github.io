Host on GitHub Pages
Host your site on GitHub Pages.
Prerequisites
Please complete the following tasks before continuing:

Create a GitHub account
Install Git
Create a Hugo site and test it locally with hugo server.
Types of sites
There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are connected to a specific project hosted on GitHub. User and organization sites are connected to a specific account on GitHub.com.

See the GitHub Pages documentation to understand the requirements for repository ownership and naming.

Procedure
Step 1
Create a GitHub repository.

Step 2
Push your local repository to GitHub.

Step 3
Visit your GitHub repository. From the main menu choose Settings > Pages. In the center of your screen you will see this:

Step 4
Change the Source to GitHub Actions. The change is immediate; you do not have to press a Save button.

Step 5
In your site configuration, change the location of the image cache to the cacheDir as shown below:




[caches]
  [caches.images]
    dir = ':cacheDir/images'
See configure file caches for more information.

Step 6
Create a file named hugo.yaml in a directory named .github/workflows.

mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/hugo.yaml
Step 7
The workflow below ensures Hugo’s cacheDir is persistent, preserving modules, processed images, and resources.GetRemote data between builds.

Copy and paste the YAML below into the file you created. Change the branch name and Hugo version as needed.

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
Step 8
Commit and push the change to your GitHub repository.

git add -A
git commit -m "Create hugo.yaml"
git push
Step 9
From GitHub’s main menu, choose Actions. You will see something like this:

Step 10
When GitHub has finished building and deploying your site, the color of the status indicator will change to green.

Step 11
Click on the commit message as shown above. You will see this:

Under the deploy step, you will see a link to your live site.

In the future, whenever you push a change from your local repository, GitHub will rebuild your site and deploy the changes.

Customize the workflow
The example workflow above includes this step, which typically takes 10‑15 seconds:

- name: Install Dart Sass
  run: sudo snap install dart-sass
You may remove this step if your site, themes, and modules do not transpile Sass to CSS using the Dart Sass transpiler.
